# World Tour Cycling API 

The main focus of this project is a Node.js and Express-based API that references a database of cycle races, scraped from procyclingstats.com. It allows users to retrieve information about individual races, as well as information about specific riders and their race history. The API is intended for cycling enthusiasts and those interested in historical race data. While the current dataset only includes the Classics from 1950 to 2023, I have plans for future development to add Grand Tours as well as individual rider statistics to the dataset.

This URL will take you to a simple API playground where you can see example routes for the API, and what the expected response objects are. 


## Tech Stack
Javascript, Express, NodeJS, Mongoose, MongoDB Atlas
## Future development 
Short term: Add all routes to API playground. 


longer term: Add information to racer model about racer weight
